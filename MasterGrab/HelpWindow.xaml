        <Bold>Explanation MasterGrab Game</Bold>
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        The MasterGrab game shows per default a map of countries for 4 players. 3 players are simulated by the computer, the countries 
        with the
        <Run Foreground="#FF4040">red colour</Run> are owned by the user. The goal is to grab all countries. 
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        The map itself has no borders, like earth, which has also no edge. The countries at the left border of the window wrap around to the right window border.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        The user makes the first move by clicking on the country he wants to attack. The computer evaluates if the attack succeeded, updates the 
        ownership of the countries on the map. Then each player simultated by the computer (=Robot) makes immediately 
        its own move. The program then waits for the user to make his next move. The game is won once the user owns all countries or
        lost when the user has no country left. Clicking on button "New Game" starts a new game. Clicking on the button "Replay" plays 
        the same game agin.

      <Paragraph>
        In this example, the mouse hovers (is just positioned over, but not clicked yet) over the green country with the number 10, 
        which indicates, how many armies are in this country. The borders of this country are marked in yellow, because the mouse 
        hovers it. The immediate neighbour countries are marked with bold boundaries. An attack will be successfull, when the sum of
        all attacking countries is <Run FontWeight="Bold" Text="more"/> than double of the defending countrie. Only the 
        user's countries which are immediate neigbours of the defender will attack. If an enemy country shares no border with any of
        your countries, you cannot attack it.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        In this example, the red countries with the numbers 4, 9 and 15 are attacking, meaning 28 armies can attack. The defender has 
        10 armies. For a successfull attack, more than double that number is needed, about 24 might be enough.
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        <Image Source="AttackHelpAfterAttack.png" Stretch="None"></Image>
      </Paragraph>
      <Paragraph>
        When the attack is successful, the attacker looses the armies needed for the attack, in this example 24, but gets
        also some bonus armies. The number of bonus armies depends on the size of the newly won country.

        and the newly won country. The more enemies a country faces, the more armies it will receive.

        Each time the users clicks, every country gains some armies until the maximum possible number of armies for this country

        Sometimes it is better not to attack, but to move armies from some owned countries to their neighbour. This has 2 advantages:

        After the click, the armies in your neighbouring countries move to the clicked country. If one of those countries has 
        enemy neighbours, some armies will be left for defence, otherwise all armies will be moved. With every future click the 
        number of armies will grow again, until they have reached their country specific limit. However, the receiving country 
        can hold an unlimitted number of armies.

        The dark areas on the map are mountains. Nobody can move there. Except there is still a bug in the game. If the mountain has
        a number, you must attack also the mountain to win the game. Luckily, this happens seldom.

            If you play against several enemies, don't fight just one. You might win over him, but the other enemies might
            grow bigger than you and beat you. Sometimes it's good to leave some weak enemy countries at your border as a
            protection against big enemies.

            Towards the end of the game, there is usually only 1, strong enemy left. In this situation, the computer plays quite
            strongly and will beat you, unless you keep collecting armies in 2-4 countries regularly.

            Changing the game parameters in the Advanced Options requires from the players quite different strategies. Try for example
