# Introduction
MasterGrab is a opensource, turnbased PC game where a human player plays against
several computer players (=Robots), trying to grab all countries of a random map. The game 
is quite fun, because the random map poses every time different problems and 
the Robots make MasterGrab a dynamic play. To win the game, 
strategic thinking is required.

For programmers, it might be even more fun to write your own Robot, which can 
be done with only few lines of code.
